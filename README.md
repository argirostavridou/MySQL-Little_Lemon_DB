Code Description:

The code in this repository is written in SQL, designed for the Little Lemon restaurant scenario. 
It sets up the Little Lemon database in MySQL, which reflects the operations of a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant located in Chicago, Illinois. 
The restaurant offers a menu inspired by Italian, Greek, and Turkish cuisines, and is owned by two brothers, Mario and Adrian.

The code accomplishes the following:

Customers: Stores customer information, enabling the restaurant to manage its clientele effectively.
Bookings: Manages reservation details to streamline the dining experience.
Courses: Contains descriptions of menu items that rotate seasonally, showcasing the restaurant's diverse offerings.

This work is based on exercises from the "Database Structures and Management with MySQL" course that I have completed on the Coursera online platform.
